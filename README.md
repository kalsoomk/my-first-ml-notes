## 📖 What I Learned

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Making machines act smart like humans.
- **ML (Machine Learning):** Teaching machines to learn patterns from data.
- **DL (Deep Learning):** Using neural networks with many layers.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing):** Teaching machines to understand text and language.
- **CV (Computer Vision):** Teaching machines to understand images.
